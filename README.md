<h1>Setting Up MySQL Server with Example Properties File</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>MySQL Server installed and running on your machine.</li>
    <li>Example properties file (e.g., <code>example.properties</code>) provided with the installation.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Step 1: Install and Configure MySQL Server</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Install MySQL Server on your machine by following the official installation guide for your operating system.</li>
    <li>Start the MySQL service and ensure it is running.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Step 2: Create a Database</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open a command prompt or terminal and log in to MySQL using the command-line client:</li>
    <pre><code>mysql -u root -p</code></pre>
    <p>You will be prompted to enter the password for the root user.</p>
    <li>Once logged in, create a new database by executing the following command:</li>
    <pre><code>CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;</code></pre>
    <p>Replace <code>your_database_name</code> with the desired name for your database.</p>
  </ol>

<h2>Step 3: Configure the Example Properties File</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Locate the example properties file (<code>example.properties</code>) provided with the MySQL installation. The file is typically found in the MySQL installation directory or its subdirectories.</li>
    <li>Make a copy of the example properties file and rename it to <code>application.properties</code>.</li>
    <li>Open the <code>application.properties</code> file in a text editor.</li>
    <li>Find the section related to the database configuration. It may look similar to the following:</li>
    <pre><code># Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>Update the <code>your_database_name</code> placeholder with the name of the database you created in Step 2.</li>
      <li>Replace <code>your_password</code> with the password for your MySQL server.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Save the changes to the <code>application.properties</code> file.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Step 4: Verify the Connection</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start or restart your application.</li>
    <li>Check the application logs for any database connection-related messages or errors. If the connection is successful, you should see messages indicating that the application has connected to the MySQL database.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>By following these steps, you should now have a MySQL server set up and configured using the example properties file provided. The <code>application.properties</code> file should contain the necessary configuration to connect to the MySQL database.</p>
